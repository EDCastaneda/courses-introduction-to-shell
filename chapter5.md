title: Building New Commands
description: >-
  - putting fixed commands in a shell script

  - executing scripts with `bash scriptname`

  - making scripts executable with `chmod` (hate to introduce this in passing,
  but...)

  - handling multiple filenames with `$@`

  - using wildcards `*` and `?`

  - using `history | tail > file.sh` to start a shell script
