# Contributing

[DataCamp](http://datacamp.com) welcomes bug reports, feature requests, and fixes. By contributing to this lesson, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can.

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1.  You can submit suggestions directly through the web-based learning interface (look for the circled exclamation mark in the upper right corner).  This will probably get the fastest response.

2.  If you have a [GitHub](http://github.com) account, you can file an issue in this lesson's repository, or file a pull request to propose an improvement.

3.  We also welcome comments by email, but will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the methods described above.

The repository for this lesson is <https://github.com/datacamp/courses-intro-to-unix-shell>.
