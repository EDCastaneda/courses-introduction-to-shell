# Contributing

[DataCamp](http://datacamp.com) welcomes bug reports, feature requests, fixes, and entirely new lessons. By contributing to this lesson, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can.

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub](http://github.com) account, you can send us comments by email. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

2.  If you have a GitHub account, but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by filing an issue in this lesson's GitHub repository. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material, you can submit a pull request (PR) in this lesson's repository.

The repository for this lesson is <https://github.com/datacamp/courses-intro-to-unix-shell>.
