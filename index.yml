course_title: Intro to Unix for Data Science
course_description: >-
  The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost fifty years because
  it lets people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes
  called "the duct tape of programming", it helps users combine existing
  programs in new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters
  and clouds that may be halfway around the world. This lesson will introduce
  its key elements and show you how to use them efficiently.

          What is the relationship between the graphical file explorer that most
          people use and the shell?

          - The file explorer lets you view and edit files, while the shell lets
          you run programs.

          - The file explorer is built on top of the shell.

          - The shell is part of the operating system, while the file explorer
          is separate.

          - They are both interfaces for issuing commands to the operating
          system.
